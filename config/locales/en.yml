    what_type: Choose the one content type that best describes the overall or primary nature of the work. Click on each content type to view and select terms you may use to further describe the work you are depositing.
    further_types: You have the option to choose one or more of the following terms to describe the work you are depositing. Click "See more options" for additional terms you may use to describe your work.
    collection:
      name: Enter a name for your collection. This name will serve as the title of the collection in the Stanford Libraries' catalog and will appear on the persistent URLs for all items deposited into this collection. It is not necessary to include the word "Collection" at the end of the title.
      description: Enter an approximately 2-3 sentence description of the works to be included in this collection. You may want to include information on who the creators of the works are/will be, when the works were/will be created, general subject matter of the works, types of works (technical reports, datasets, video archives, etc), and the scholarly value of the content.
      contact_email: Enter one or more valid email addresses where people can write to ask questions about this collection. Consider using a group address where messages will be seen by more than one person and that may be active longer than a single personal email address to ensure that questions are received. Email addresses will appear on your persistent URL page.
      related_link: This section allows you to provide links to other web pages that are related to your collection. These links will display on the persistent URL (PURL) page for the collection and on the Stanford Libraries' catalog record. Enter the text to be displayed on the page in the "Link title" box. This entire text will be hyperlinked to the URL you enter in the "URL" box. Examples of content you might consider linking to are key funder websites,  lab or institute websites, or project pages.
      release: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) Depositors to this collection are required to make the files on their deposits downloadable as soon as the deposit is completed ("Immediately"), 2) if downloading will be delayed for all Depositors until a certain date ("Delay release until…"), or 3) if Depositors can decide for themselves when downloading of their content will be available ("Depositor selects…"). Note that for all of these options the PURL page is always visible as soon as the deposit is complete and all metadata on the page is visible to anyone.
      access: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) Depositors to this collection are required to make the files on their deposits downloadable by anyone in the world ("Everyone"), 2) if downloading of files for all deposits will be restricted to the Stanford community ("Stanford community"), or 3) if Depositors can decide for themselves which of these options to choose ("Depositor selects"). For the "Depositor selects" option, the default option presented to the Depositor will be the "Everyone" option, but they will be able to choose "Stanford community" if they choose.
      terms: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) a specific license  you choose from the list will be mandatory for every deposit to the collection ("Require license for all deposits") or 2) if the Depositors will be able to choose the license they wish to use ("Depositor selects license").  For this second option, you must choose a license from the list to be displayed as the default option for Depositors.
      managers: Managers have the ability to edit the collection description; add and remove other Managers, Reviewers, and Depositors; adjust discovery, access, and license settings for the collection; and edit any content deposited to the collection, including content deposited by others.
      depositors: Depositors are allowed to add works to the collection, but cannot see or edit the works deposited by others.
      reviewers: Reviewers receive notifications of deposits submitted for approval. Reviewers can approve, edit, or return works to Depositors. Reviewers cannot edit collection information or settings or add/remove collection participants.
